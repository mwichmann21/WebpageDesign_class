	<h2> History </h2>
	<hr />
	<p> The Shanghai tunnels are the infamous Portland underground tunnels. These tunnel 
	hold a reputation of being the center of illegal activities and business for the 
	Chinese community. </p>
	<p> The first wave of Chinese immigrants entered Portland in the 1850s. During this 
	time there were high anti-Chinese sentiment across America against Chinese laborers. 
	It is believed that the tunnels were used to help move product to and from the 
	waterfront. They tunnels connected to stores, and therefore they were able to keep 
	off the streets. </p>
	<p> Portland used their tunnels in daylight hours to deliver goods and businesses but
	during the evening hours, there was horrible criminal activity. There was drugs,
	prostitution, gambling and illegal booze. 
	<br />
	
	<!--Criminal Activity-->
	<h3> Criminal Activity </h3>
	<hr />
	<h4>There was drugs, prostitution, gambling and illegal booze. Trafficking and sex 
	trade led to many deaths under the streets. </h4>
	<p>Portland developed a reputation for being a gritty port town in the late 1800s. A 
	number of illegal activities occurred during this time were found in the tunnels. 
	There were secret stairways, doors and tunnels. Portland was living up its reputation 
	of being a violent and dangerous city. There was illegal dealings of drug. There was 
	also illegal gambling. Gambling would occur in gambling dens that were in the tunnels.
	During the prohibition era, these tunnels and basements provided a convenient way 
	conduct illegal selling and consumption of alcohol without being caught. Illegal 
	boxing was popular during the Prohibition Era. Matches were held in unlikely places, 
	the Shanghai tunnels was a popular place to conduct matches because they were out of 
	the rain and were unseen by everyday businesses. Illegal saloons were also 
	conveniently held in the tunnels. </p>
	
	<!--Human Trafficking-->
	<h3> 1850-1941: Human Trafficking </h3>
	<hr />
	<p> Ship Captains hired vicious thugs called crimps to spot men new to town. They 
	would buy and the drink and add drugs to it before giving it to them. They would drop 
	them down into the tunnels.  A bounty was paid of 50 dollars but the crimps had to 
	cram into small wooden cages without food or drink. After a couple days they were 
	given another drug that would allow them move to the ships after being sold to various 
	Captains. Crimps also befriended young women and imprisoned them in tunnels. After 
	being kidnapped they were kept in isolation in a box alone. Within the next couple 
	hours or days, they were convinced that they were forced into sex trade. </p>
	
	<h4> By 1941, human trafficking of men and women became unprofitable so the practice 
	were stopped entirely. They stayed off limites until the Cascade Historial Society 
	discovered them. Now they give tours. </h4>

	<b>Haunted History</b>
	<br /> 
	The Underground Portland tour through Cascade Geographical Society was quite an 
	experience. The tunnels alone were haunted..but imaging the terror and demise is much 
	more haunting. A couple of times I felt light-headed and nauseated. The tunnels have 
	a sense of desperation <p>
