	    <h2> Discovery </h2>
	    <p>
	    The Ili Pika was first photographed in 2014 for the first time in more than 20 
	    years. Li Weidong discovered the pika in 1983 and named it after its hometown Ili. 
	    However, it wasn't known because it wasn't photographed until 2014 when Li spotted 
	    and photographed the creature for the first time sine the early 1990s. Li estimates
	    that the numbers have declined 70% since its discovery. 
	    <br /> <br />
	    The Ili pika, a tiny emountain-dwelling mammal with a teddy bear face eluded 
	    scientists in the Tianshan Mountains of northwestern China. Only a handful of 
	    people have seen this creature since it was discovered. </p>
	    <br /> <br />
	    <h2> What is an Ili Pika? </h2>
	   	<p>The animal is about 8 inches long with large ears and several brown spots in 
	    its gray fur. The Ili pika lives on sloping bare rock races and feeds on grasses at 
	    high elevations. Similar to other high-dwelling creatures, the pikas are sensitive 
	    to changes in its environment. </p>

	    <h2> Conservation</h2>
	    <img id="map" src="IliPika7.jpg" alt="IliPika Population Map">
	    <p> Grazing pressure from livestock and air pollution have contributed ot he decline 
	    in the Ili pika which the International Union for Conservation considers to be 
	    vulnerable to extinction. Additionally, Li believes that the pikas are forced to 
	    gradually retreat to mountain tops due to the rising temperatures, from climate change.
	    The Ili Pikas have adapted to the cold. Li adds that the Ili Pikas have nowhere 
	    else to retreat making them endangered. The Ili Pikas population decline is thought 
	    to have been human's fault because people who live on pastor land have their sheep 
	    and horse graze on alpine vegetation at higher altitudes which is competing with 
	    the Ili Pikas. He adds that this species of pikas are not as vocal, so if a predators
	    was to come, then the Ili Pikas would not be able to alert each other. He continues 
	    to mention that disease may also be a factor in this decline. <br /> <br />The team of 
	    scientists calculated that there was 2,000 Ili Pikas in 2003, down from 2,900 in 
	    1983-1993 readings. Now there are only 1,000 left in the wild. As of 2016, the Ili
	    Pika was not included on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection.
	    <b><i> They are now considered to be rarer than pandas and this is saying
	    something!</i></b> As of July 2015, there was no official organization or team 
	    dedicated to studying or protecting the Ili Pika. Li, who discovered the Ili Pika, 
	    says, "If it becomes extinct in front of me, I'll feel so guilty."
	    The case calls for the most extreme conservation measures, however
	    since they are rarely spotted, it is hard to help the cause other than donating money 
	    towards research and creating awareness.</p>
