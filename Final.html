    	    	<h1>Biography</h1>
    	    	<img id="first" src="piscopia1.jpg" alt="Elena Cornaro Piscopia">
    	    	<p> Short for <b>Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia</b>, Elena Cornaro was 
    	    	born in Venice Italy in 1646. She is known for being the first woman to 
    	    	receive a PhD. The Cornaro family was known for commissioning the creation 
    	    	of palaces, chapels, church art, villas, paintings, theaters and more; 
    	    	already making a mark in Venetian history. 
    	    	
    	    	<h2> Education </h2>
    	    	Elena Cornaro was an Italian scholar who studied mathematics, astronomy,
    	    	philosophy, music and theology. She was fluent in 7 languages other than 
    	    	her native language and played many instruments including harpsichord, 
    	    	clavichord, harp, violin, and singer. At 19, she was widely known as the 
    	    	most learned woman in Italy. Some of the best scientists, clergymen and 
    	    	noblemen in Europe came to visit Cornaro. In 1669, at the age of 23 she 
    	    	translate "Dialogue between Christ our Redeemer and a Devoted Soul" from 
    	    	Spanish to Italian. The fame of this huge accomplishment spread and she 
    	    	was invited to join scholarly societies. In 1670, she became the president 
    	    	of the Venetian society Accademia dei Pacifici. <br />
    	    	In 1672, Carlo Rinaldini, and Felice Rotondi petitioned 
    	    	<!--Link within paragraph-->
    	    	<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Padua" target=" blank">University 
    	    	of Padua</a> to give Cornaro a doctoral degree in theology. The bishop of 
    	    	Padua assumed Cornaro was seeking a degree and supported her pursuit of 
    	    	degree, but after discovering she sought a degree in theology, he refused 
    	    	to grant her the degree because she was a woman. 
    	    	However in 1678, her defense was held in the cathedral of Padua which 
    	    	consisted of explaining two passages chosen at random from Aristotle.

    	    	<br />
    	    	After earning all the necessary credits to receive her PhD in theology, a
    	    	year after the famed debate, she was not allowed to graduate because the 
    	    	Roman Catholic Church did not think it was proper that a woman earn a 
    	    	degree in theology. Members at the university did not believe that was right, 
    	    	so they allowed her to receive a degree in philosophy instead of theology. 
    	    	She was awarded this degree at the age of 32 years. 
    	    	<br />
    	    	<h2> Other works </h2>
    	    	In 1665, she became an <a href="http://www.osb.org/obl/intro.html" target=" blank">
    	    	oblate in the Benedictine order</a>, and after receiving 
    	    	her degree, she furthered her studies and ministered to the poor. The 
    	    	extensive charitable work, rigorous penances and extreme dedication to her
    	    	studies took a tool on her weak physical condition as she died in 1684. <p>
